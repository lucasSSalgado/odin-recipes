        <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>500 g of raw black-eyed peas</li>
            <li>500 g of onion</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 small onion with skin</li>
            <li>500 ml of oil</li>
            <li>500 ml palm oil</li>
            <li>2 cups of vatapá tea</li>
            <li>150 g dried shrimp</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>HOW TO DO</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Place the whole beans in a food processor and pulse for a few seconds to break up the beans.</li>
            <li>Place the beans in a container and cover with water.</li>
            <li>Soak for at least 12 hours.</li>
            <li>Shake the beans with a spoon and use a sieve to remove all the husks that come off the beans.</li>
            <li>After removing the skins a lot, wash the beans under running water and continue removing ?the little eye? and the rest of the shells.</li>
            <li>Remove as much as possible and reserve.</li>
            <li>Peel the onions, cut into pieces and reserve again.</li>
            <li>In a processor, place the beans and onions.</li>
            <li>Beat for 3 minutes, or until you get a smooth and uniform paste.</li>
            <li>Remove all the paste from the processor and place it inside a large, deep pan.</li>
            <li>With a wooden spoon, beat the acarajé mixture until the mixture triples in volume.</li>
            <li>This process is quite time consuming but is very important for fermentation.</li>
            <li>Place the oil, palm oil, and unpeeled onion in a medium saucepan and heat over high heat.</li>
            <li>With two tablespoons, shape the acarajés: fill one of the spoons with the dough, transfer from one spoon to the other until the dough is shaped like a dumpling.</li>
            <li>Place the dumplings in the very hot oil and fry for 3 minutes on one side.</li>
            <li>With a slotted spoon, flip the dumplings and fry until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Adjust the oil temperature.</li>
            <li>If necessary, lower the flame of the fire so that the oil does not burn.</li>
            <li>Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and place on absorbent paper.</li>
            <li>Cut the dumplings in half and fill with vatapá.</li>
            <li>Place the dried shrimp inside the acarajé and close.</li>
        </ul>
